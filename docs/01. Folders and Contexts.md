# Structuring Our Domain: Folders and Bounded Contexts

In the prologue, we established why pairing Laravel and DDD is a worthwhile challenge, especially for complex, long-lived applications. Now, it's time to move from theory to practice. The first, and perhaps most fundamental, step to ensuring our architecture's success is to create a skeleton for our code that reflects the principles of DDD.

This means abandoning, or rather, augmenting Laravel's default folder structure.

### The Problem with Laravel's Default Structure

The out-of-the-box folder structure that Laravel provides is simple and effective for rapid development and traditional CRUD architectures:

```
/app
  /Http
    /Controllers
  /Models
  /Providers
  ...
```

The problem is that this structure groups files by their **technical type**, not by their **business function**. An `OrderController`, an `Order` model, and an `OrderShipped` event will all be in completely separate directories. As the application grows, the logic for a single business concept (like "Orders") becomes scattered throughout the entire system. This leads to:

* **Low Cohesion:** Code that changes together is not grouped together.
* **High Coupling:** It's difficult to see the boundaries between different business areas, making it easy to create unwanted dependencies.
* **Difficulty Navigating:** Finding all the logic related to a feature becomes a detective task.

To solve this, DDD introduces a key concept: the Bounded Context.

### The Key Concept: Bounded Contexts

A **Bounded Context** is an explicit boundary within which a domain model has a single, unified meaning. In other words, it's a sub-system of your application focused on a specific area of the business.

Let's consider an e-commerce application. At first glance, you might think of a single "Product" model. But the word "Product" means different things to different teams:

* For the **Sales** team, a Product has a `price`, `name`, `description`, and `applicable_discounts`.
* For the **Inventory** team, that same Product has a `SKU`, `stock_level`, `warehouse_location`, and `package_dimensions`.
* For the **Support** team, a Product has `user_manuals`, `FAQs`, and `warranties`.

Trying to cram all this information into a single, giant `Product` model is a recipe for disaster. DDD tells us to create a **different model** for each context. We would have a `Sales` Bounded Context and an `Inventory` Bounded Context. Inside `Sales`, the `Product` model would have its sales-related attributes. Inside `Inventory`, the `Product` model would have its warehouse-related attributes.

The Bounded Context boundary ensures that the model remains clean, focused, and consistent within its area of responsibility.

### Creating the Folder Structure for DDD

To reflect these contexts in our Laravel project, we'll create a new structure. The most common and clean practice is to add a new `src` directory in the project root, which will contain all our domain code, leaving the `app` directory for framework configuration and "glue" code.

Our new structure will look like this:

```
/app          // For framework "glue" code
/bootstrap
/config
/database
/public
/resources
/routes
/modules      // <-- Our code will live here!
  /Sales      // <-- Sales Bounded Context
  /Inventory  // <-- Inventory Bounded Context
/storage
/tests
```

Inside each Bounded Context, we'll create folders for each of the layers of the DDD architecture.

```
/modules
  /Sales
    /Application    // Application logic (Use Cases)
    /Domain         // The heart: Entities, VOs, Events
    /Infrastructure // Implementations: Eloquent, APIs...
  /Inventory
    /Application
    /Domain
    /Infrastructure
```

### A Look at the Layers

Let's see what kind of files go into each of these new folders, using our `Sales` context as an example:

* `modules/Sales/Domain`: **The Heart.** This is the most important and isolated layer.
    * **Contains:** Entities (`Order`, `Product`), Value Objects (`Price`, `Address`), Repository Interfaces (`OrderRepositoryInterface`), Domain Events (`OrderWasPlaced`).
    * **Golden Rule:** It contains **absolutely no Laravel code** or other external libraries. It's pure PHP. It doesn't know about databases or HTTP.

* `modules/Sales/Application`: **The Orchestrator.** This layer directs the workflow.
    * **Contains:** Application Services or Use Cases (e.g., `PlaceOrderUseCase`), and DTOs (Data Transfer Objects).
    * **Function:** It receives simple data (for example, from a controller), tells the Domain to execute business logic, and uses the Repository interfaces to persist changes.

* `modules/Sales/Infrastructure`: **The Implementation Details.** This is where we connect our domain to the real world and to Laravel.
    * **Contains:** The concrete implementation of the domain's interfaces (e.g., `EloquentOrderRepository` which implements `OrderRepositoryInterface`), API Clients, Mailers, etc.
    * **It also contains Controllers:** An `OrderController` would live in `src/Sales/Infrastructure/Http/Controllers`. Its job is to translate an HTTP request into a call to a Use Case in the Application layer.

### Making It Work: Integrating the New Structure with Laravel

Laravel doesn't know our `modules` directory exists, so we have to tell it.

1.  **Modify your `composer.json`:** Open the `composer.json` file in your project root and add your new namespace to the `autoload` -> `psr-4` section. We'll create an `App` namespace that points to the `src` directory.

    ```json
    // composer.json

    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "App\\": "modules/",
            "Database\\Factories\\": "database/factories/",
            "Database\\Seeders\\": "database/seeders/"
        }
    },
    ```
    *Note: We've changed `App\\` from pointing to `app/` to `modules/`. This is an important design decision. `App` is now the root namespace for our main application code.*

2.  **Refresh the Autoloader:** Once you've saved the file, run this command in your terminal:

    ```shell
    composer dump-autoload
    ```

    Now Laravel will automatically load any class you create inside `src` following the `App` namespace. For example, an `Order` class in the `Sales` context would be located at `modules/Sales/Domain/Entities/Order.php` and its namespace would be `App\Sales\Domain\Entities`.

**What about the `/app` directory?**

Don't delete it! The `app` directory remains the perfect home for framework-specific classes, such as:

* `app/Providers` (Service Providers)
* `app/Http/Kernel.php`
* `app/Console/Kernel.php`
* `app/Exceptions/Handler.php`

This way, we maintain a very healthy separation: `modules` is for our code, the code that models the business. `app` is for the code that makes the framework run.

### Conclusion

We have laid the foundation. It might seem like a lot of initial work, but this folder structure will pay huge dividends in the future. Our code is now organized by its business function, it's easier to navigate, and we have created clear boundaries that prevent unwanted coupling.

Now that we have the drawers, it's time to fill them.

**In the next chapter, we will dive into the most important layer of all: the Domain Layer. We will create our first pure Entities and Value Objects, writing the true heart of our business logic.**
