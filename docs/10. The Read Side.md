# Implementing the Read Side: Queries and Read Models

In the last chapter, our event-driven architecture came to life. We created Listeners that react to events, including a `Projector` whose job is to build and maintain an optimized read model in a Redis cache. The data is now pre-prepared and waiting.

This chapter is about cashing in on that hard work. We will implement the **Read Stack** to consume the data from Redis, bypassing our main SQL database entirely to achieve maximum performance.

### Step 1: The Read Model

This piece of our architecture does not change. The Read Model is the DTO that defines the data contract for our UI. The UI's needs are the same regardless of where the data comes from.

`src/Sales/Application/Queries/GetOrderHistory/OrderHistoryItem.php`
```php
<?php

namespace App\Sales\Application\Queries\GetOrderHistory;

/**
 * Read Model: A simple DTO to represent an item in the order history.
 * It contains no business logic.
 */
final readonly class OrderHistoryItem
{
    public function __construct(
        public string $orderId,
        public string $orderDate,
        public string $status,
        public string $total // Formatted as a string for the view
    ) {}
}
```

### Step 2: The Query Handler (Reading from Redis)

Here is the heart of our read stack. This handler will no longer speak SQL via Eloquent; it will speak the language of Redis to fetch our pre-projected data.

`src/Sales/Application/Queries/GetOrderHistory/GetOrderHistoryQueryHandler.php`
```php
<?php

namespace App\Sales\Application\Queries\GetOrderHistory;

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Redis;
use Illuminate\Support\Collection;
use Carbon\Carbon;

final class GetOrderHistoryQueryHandler
{
    public function __construct()
    {
        // We could inject a Redis client here to make testing even easier.
    }

    /**
     * @return Collection<int, OrderHistoryItem>
     */
    public function handle(string $customerId): Collection
    {
        // 1. Point to the Sorted Set key that holds the customer's order IDs.
        $customerOrdersKey = "customer:{$customerId}:orders";

        // 2. Get the order IDs, sorted from newest to oldest.
        // ZREVRANGE gets a range of members from a sorted set, by index, ordered from high to low score.
        $orderIds = Redis::zrevrange($customerOrdersKey, 0, -1);
        if (empty($orderIds)) {
            return collect();
        }

        // 3. Use a pipeline to efficiently get the details for all orders.
        // This sends all commands to Redis at once, reducing network latency.
        $pipe = Redis::pipeline();
        foreach ($orderIds as $orderId) {
            // HGETALL gets all the fields and values in a hash.
            $pipe->hgetall("order:{$orderId}:details");
        }
        $results = $pipe->execute();

        // 4. Map the raw Redis data into our Read Model DTOs.
        return collect($results)
            ->filter() // Filter out any potential null results if a hash didn't exist.
            ->map(
                fn (array $orderData) => new OrderHistoryItem(
                    orderId: $orderData['orderId'],
                    orderDate: Carbon::parse($orderData['orderDate'])->toFormattedDateString(),
                    status: $orderData['status'],
                    total: $orderData['total']
                )
            );
    }
}
```

### Step 3: The Controller (Unchanged)

And here lies the ultimate proof of our architecture's power. The controller that requests the data does not need to be changed at all. It remains completely agnostic to the data source.

`src/Sales/Infrastructure/Http/Controllers/GetOrderHistoryController.php`
```php
<?php
namespace App\Sales\Infrastructure\Http\Controllers;

use App\Sales\Application\Queries\GetOrderHistory\GetOrderHistoryQueryHandler;
use Illuminate\Http\JsonResponse;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;
use App\Shared\Infrastructure\Http\Controllers\Controller;

final class GetOrderHistoryController extends Controller
{
    public function __construct(private readonly GetOrderHistoryQueryHandler $handler) {}

    // THIS FILE REQUIRES NO CHANGES!
    public function __invoke(Request $request): JsonResponse
    {
        $customerId = Auth::id();
        // ... validation ...

        // The handler does its job; the controller doesn't know (or care) if it's SQL or Redis.
        $orderHistory = $this->handler->handle($customerId);

        return response()->json($orderHistory);
    }
}
```

### Conclusion: Eventual Consistency and Massive Performance

We have successfully implemented an advanced CQRS pattern where the write and read stacks not only use different models but also **different database technologies**.

The advantage is **massive read performance**. Queries to an in-memory database like Redis are orders of magnitude faster than queries to a SQL database.

The trade-off we make is for **eventual consistency**. There might be a tiny delay (milliseconds, or seconds if the projector is queued) between the data being written to SQL and being reflected in Redis. For the vast majority of read use cases (histories, catalogs, dashboards), this delay is a perfectly acceptable trade for the enormous gain in speed.

Our architecture is now functionally complete. We know how to write data, how to read it, and how to have our modules communicate. We are only missing one pillar: confidence.

**In the final implementation chapter, `Chapter 10: Ensuring Quality: Testing Strategies`, we will explore how this highly segmented architecture allows us to write effective and reliable tests for each of its parts.**
