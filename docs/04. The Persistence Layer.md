# Taming Eloquent: The Persistence Layer and Repositories

We have designed a rich and expressive Domain Layer. Our Aggregates, like `Order`, not only protect their state but also record important events that occur. However, all this logic lives in memory. We now need to build the bridge that connects our domain to the database.

This is the role of the **Persistence Layer** and its central pattern, the **Repository**. Our challenge is to use Laravel's powerful Eloquent ORM without letting its implementation details "contaminate" our domain.

### The Repository Pattern and its Contract in the Domain

A Repository is an abstraction that acts like an in-memory collection of our Aggregates. The repository's **interface**, which is the contract our application will use, lives in the Domain Layer and is completely agnostic to the persistence technology.

`src/Sales/Domain/Repositories/OrderRepositoryInterface.php`
```php
<?php
namespace App\Sales\Domain\Repositories;

use App\Sales\Domain\Entities\Order;
use App\Sales\Domain\ValueObjects\OrderId;

interface OrderRepositoryInterface
{
    /**
     * Finds an Order Aggregate by its identity.
     */
    public function findById(OrderId $id): ?Order;

    /**
     * Saves the current state of an Order Aggregate.
     * This handles both creation and updates.
     */
    public function save(Order $order): void;

    /**
     * Generates a new unique identity for an Order.
     */
    public function nextIdentity(): OrderId;
}
```

### Implementing the Repository in the Infrastructure

The concrete implementation, which uses Eloquent, resides in the Infrastructure Layer. This is where we handle the database "plumbing."

**1. The Eloquent Models**

We need Eloquent models that map to our tables. These are implementation details and should not be confused with our Domain Entities.

`src/Sales/Infrastructure/Persistence/Eloquent/OrderModel.php`
```php
<?php
namespace App\Sales\Infrastructure\Persistence\Eloquent;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\HasMany;

final class OrderModel extends Model
{
    protected $table = 'orders';
    protected $keyType = 'string';
    public $incrementing = false;
    public $timestamps = true;

    // We define the relationship here for use within the infrastructure layer.
    public function lines(): HasMany
    {
        return $this->hasMany(OrderLineModel::class, 'order_id');
    }
}
```
We would also have a corresponding `OrderLineModel.php` for the order lines table.

**2. The Concrete Repository Implementation**

This class implements the `OrderRepositoryInterface` and contains all the Eloquent-specific logic.

`src/Sales/Infrastructure/Persistence/EloquentOrderRepository.php`
```php
<?php
namespace App\Sales\Infrastructure\Persistence;

// ... (Imports for both Domain and Infrastructure classes)
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;
use Ramsey\Uuid\Uuid;

final class EloquentOrderRepository implements OrderRepositoryInterface
{
    public function findById(OrderId $id): ?Order
    {
        // We eager load relationships to prevent N+1 problems.
        $orderModel = OrderModel::with('lines')->find($id->value());

        return $orderModel ? $this->toDomain($orderModel) : null;
    }

    public function save(Order $order): void
    {
        // Using a transaction ensures the consistency of the entire Aggregate.
        DB::transaction(function () use ($order) {
            $orderModel = OrderModel::find($order->id()->value()) 
                ?? new OrderModel(['id' => $order->id()->value()]);

            // Map the state from the aggregate root to the Eloquent model.
            $orderModel->status = $order->status()->value;
            $orderModel->customer_id = $order->customerId()->value();
            // ... other fields
            $orderModel->save();

            // Synchronize the child entities (the order lines).
            $orderModel->lines()->delete(); // A simple strategy: delete and re-create.
            $lineModelsData = [];
            foreach ($order->getLines() as $domainLine) {
                $lineModelsData[] = [
                    'id' => $domainLine->id()->value(),
                    'product_id' => $domainLine->productId()->value(),
                    'quantity' => $domainLine->quantity(),
                    // ... other line fields
                ];
            }
            if (!empty($lineModelsData)) {
                $orderModel->lines()->createMany($lineModelsData);
            }
        });
    }

    public function nextIdentity(): OrderId
    {
        return new OrderId(Uuid::uuid4()->toString());
    }

    /**
     * Private mapper to convert an Eloquent model into a Domain Entity.
     */
    private function toDomain(OrderModel $model): Order
    {
        // Mapping logic to reconstruct the Order entity and its OrderLines
        // from the Eloquent models, as seen in the previous chapter.
        // ...
        return new Order(/* ... reconstructed parameters ... */);
    }
}
```

> **Key Note on Events**
>
> You might notice that in the `save` method, we do absolutely nothing with the domain events we recorded in our `Order` Aggregate. **This is intentional and correct.** The Repository's sole responsibility is the persistence of the aggregate's **state**. It is completely ignorant of events. As we will see later, it is the `CommandHandler` in the Application Layer that will pull and dispatch the events *after* the `save()` method has completed successfully.

### Wiring It Up with the Service Container

Finally, we tell Laravel how to resolve our interface. This part doesn't change, which demonstrates the power of abstraction.

`src/Sales/Infrastructure/Providers/SalesServiceProvider.php`
```php
<?php
namespace App\Sales\Infrastructure\Providers;

use App\Sales\Domain\Repositories\OrderRepositoryInterface;
use App\Sales\Infrastructure\Persistence\EloquentOrderRepository;
use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;

final class SalesServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function register(): void
    {
        $this->app->bind(
            OrderRepositoryInterface::class,
            EloquentOrderRepository::class
        );
    }
}
```
Don't forget to register this new provider in your `bootstrap/app.php` file.

### Conclusion

We have built a robust and well-defined bridge between our Domain and the database. Eloquent is working for us, but it is confined to the Infrastructure Layer, respecting the boundaries of our Domain. Our Repository knows how to persist the state of a complex Aggregate while deliberately ignoring other concerns like events, demonstrating an excellent separation of concerns.

Now that we have a Domain that generates events and a way to persist it, we are ready for the next step.

**In the next chapter, `Chapter 5: The Application Layer and User Intent`, we will formalize our application layer under the CQRS pattern and finally see how the events recorded by our Domain are dispatched.**
