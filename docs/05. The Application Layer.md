# The Application Layer and User Intent (DTOs and Services)

We have already built the foundations and the core of our application. We have a pure **Domain Layer** with our business logic and a robust **Infrastructure Layer** that knows how to persist that domain. But how do we connect the outside world to this core? How is a user's intention, like "I want to place an order," translated into a concrete action within our system?

The answer is the **Application Layer**. This layer is the main entry point for any client (a web controller, a console command, a queued job). Its sole mission is to receive user intent and orchestrate the pieces of our system to fulfill it.

### Capturing Intent with DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)

The first step is to represent the user's intent in a clean, structured way. We don't want our application logic to depend on a Laravel `Request` object, as that would couple it to HTTP.

For this, we use **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**. As we've seen, they are simple, immutable classes with no behavior, whose only purpose is to transport data between layers. They are the "message" that the client sends to the Application Layer.

For the intent to "place an order," our DTO remains the perfect example:

`src/Sales/Application/DTOs/PlaceOrderInput.php`
```php
<?php
namespace App\Sales\Application\DTOs;

final readonly class PlaceOrderInput
{
    /**
     * @param string $customerId
     * @param array<int, array{productId: string, quantity: int}> $products
     */
    public function __construct(
        public string $customerId,
        public array $products
    ) {}
}
```
This DTO captures all the necessary information for the use case in a clear, typed, and framework-agnostic way.

### Processing Intent with Application Services

Once we have the intent encapsulated in a DTO, we need a class to process it. We will call this class an **Application Service** (also known as a Use Case).

An Application Service is the orchestra conductor. **It contains no business logic itself**, but it directs the actors that do. Its workflow is always very similar:

1.  It accepts an input DTO (the intent).
2.  It uses a Repository to find or prepare Domain Entities.
3.  It invokes methods on the Entities to execute business logic.
4.  It uses the Repository again to persist the changes.
5.  Optionally, it returns an output DTO with the result.

`src/Sales/Application/Services/PlaceOrderService.php`
```php
<?php
namespace App\Sales\Application\Services;

use App\Sales\Application\DTOs\PlaceOrderInput;
use App\Sales\Application\DTOs\PlaceOrderOutput;
use App\Sales\Domain\Repositories\OrderRepositoryInterface;
// ... more imports

final class PlaceOrderService
{
    public function __construct(
        private readonly OrderRepositoryInterface $orderRepository,
        // ... other dependencies like a price finder, etc.
    ) {}

    public function execute(PlaceOrderInput $input): PlaceOrderOutput
    {
        // 1. Orchestrate fetching and creating domain entities...
        $orderId = $this->orderRepository->nextIdentity();
        $order = new Order($orderId, /* ... */);

        // 2. Delegate business logic to the entities...
        foreach ($input->products as $product) {
            // ... find price
            $order->addLine(/* ... */);
        }

        // 3. Persist the result...
        $this->orderRepository->save($order);

        // 4. Return the result...
        return new PlaceOrderOutput($orderId->value());
        
        // Note: The detailed and final implementation will be seen in later chapters.
        // The goal here is to understand the service's role.
    }
}
```

### The Crucial Distinction: Writes vs. Reads

So far, our `PlaceOrderService` represents an intent to **change** state: creating a new `Order`. This is a **write operation**. These operations are complex by nature: they require validation, they guarantee consistency, and they must use our rich Domain Model to enforce business rules.

But what about a different kind of intent? For example, "I want to see my order history." This is a **read operation**. Its goal is not to change state, but simply to retrieve and display it.

If we tried to create a `GetOrderHistoryService` using our `OrderRepository`, we would run into an efficiency problem. We would be loading full `Order` Aggregates, with all their business logic and child entities, just to display a few fields in a table. It's like using a freight truck to deliver a letter to the mailbox next door.

This distinction is fundamental:
* **Write Operations (Commands):** Complex, focused on consistency, use the rich Domain Model.
* **Read Operations (Queries):** Simple, focused on performance, do not need the Domain Model's business logic.

### Conclusion

The Application Layer is the interpreter between the outside world and the heart of our system. It uses DTOs to understand user intent and Application Services to orchestrate the response.

More importantly, it has led us to discover a fundamental duality in the operations of any system: those that write data and those that read it. Trying to solve both with the same tools is inefficient and complicated.

This revelation is the gateway to the next level of our architecture.

**In the next chapter, `Chapter 6: Introducing CQRS: Separating Commands and Queries`, we will formalize this separation. We will design two optimized and distinct paths within our application: one for Commands (writes) and one for Queries (reads), taking our Modular Monolith to its full potential.**
