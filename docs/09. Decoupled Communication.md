# Decoupled Communication: Domain Events and Listeners

In the previous chapter, our `PlaceOrderCommandHandler` successfully dispatched an `OrderWasPlaced` event. The signal was sent, but into the void. No one was waiting for it.

In this chapter, we will build the receivers for that signal. We will create **Listeners**, which are classes designed to react to specific events. This will allow us to implement communication between the different Bounded Contexts of our monolith without creating direct coupling. We will see how the `Sales` module can trigger actions in the `Inventory` and `Notifications` modules without even knowing they exist.

### The Listener: The Event Reactor

A Listener is a class that subscribes to a type of event. When the **Event Bus** dispatches an event, it notifies all of its registered listeners.

Listeners often have two primary purposes:
1.  **Reactors:** They *react* to an event by performing an action (e.g., sending an email, calling an external API).
2.  **Projectors:** They *project* the data from an event into a denormalized read model (e.g., updating a search index or a Redis cache).

Let's implement one of each for our `OrderWasPlaced` event.

### Implementation 1: The Listener as a "Reactor"

A reactor is a listener that executes an action in response to an event. We will implement the listener to send an order confirmation email.

`src/Notifications/Application/Listeners/SendOrderConfirmationEmailListener.php`
```php
<?php
namespace App\Notifications\Application\Listeners;

use App\Sales\Domain\Events\OrderWasPlaced; // The Listener is coupled to the Event, not the module!
use App\Shared\Application\Services\CustomerFinder; // A service to find customer data
use App\Shared\Domain\Interfaces\MailerInterface; // An abstraction for the email service
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue; // Optional: for asynchronous execution

// Implementing ShouldQueue tells Laravel to run this listener in a background job queue.
final class SendOrderConfirmationEmailListener implements ShouldQueue
{
    public function __construct(
        private readonly MailerInterface $mailer,
        private readonly CustomerFinder $customerFinder
    ) {}

    /**
     * The `handle` method name is a Laravel convention.
     */
    public function handle(OrderWasPlaced $event): void
    {
        // The listener receives the full event object with all its data.
        $customerEmail = $this->customerFinder->findEmailById($event->customerId);

        if ($customerEmail) {
            // It interacts with infrastructure (sending the email).
            $this->mailer->send(
                to: $customerEmail,
                subject: "Confirmation for your order {$event->aggregateId}",
                body: "Thank you for your purchase..."
            );
        }
    }
}
```

### Implementation 2: The Listener as a "Projector"

A projector is a listener whose sole job is to take data from an event and **project** it into an optimized read model—in our case, a Redis cache. Its purpose is to prepare data so that queries will be lightning-fast.

This projector will build the "order history" view that we'll need in the next chapter.

`src/Sales/Application/Projectors/OrderHistoryProjector.php`
```php
<?php
namespace App\Sales\Application\Projectors;

use App\Sales\Domain\Events\OrderWasPlaced;
// We could listen to more events here, like OrderWasShipped, to update the status.
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Redis;

final class OrderHistoryProjector implements ShouldQueue
{
    public function handle(OrderWasPlaced $event): void
    {
        // 1. Define the Redis key for the customer's sorted set of order IDs.
        $customerOrdersKey = "customer:{$event->customerId}:orders";

        // 2. Define the key for the hash that will store the order details.
        $orderDetailsKey = "order:{$event->aggregateId}:details";

        // 3. Create the read model as an associative array.
        //    The data is denormalized and ready to be consumed.
        $readModel = [
            'orderId' => $event->aggregateId,
            'orderDate' => $event->occurredOn->format('Y-m-d H:i:s'),
            'status' => 'Pending', // Initial status
            'total' => $this->calculateTotalFromLines($event->lines),
            'customerId' => $event->customerId
        ];

        // 4. Use a Redis pipeline to execute multiple commands atomically.
        Redis::pipeline(function ($pipe) use ($customerOrdersKey, $orderDetailsKey, $readModel, $event) {
            // Save the order details in a Hash.
            $pipe->hMSet($orderDetailsKey, $readModel);
            
            // Add the order ID to the customer's sorted set, using the timestamp as the score for ordering.
            $score = $event->occurredOn->getTimestamp();
            $pipe->zAdd($customerOrdersKey, $score, $event->aggregateId);
        });
    }

    private function calculateTotalFromLines(array $lines): string
    {
        $totalCents = array_reduce($lines, fn ($sum, $line) => $sum + $line['price_amount'] * $line['quantity'], 0);
        return number_format($totalCents / 100, 2) . ' EUR';
    }
}
```

### Registering the Listeners in Laravel

We've created our reactors, but how does the Event Bus know to call them when an `OrderWasPlaced` event is dispatched? We tell it in Laravel's `EventServiceProvider`.

`app/Providers/EventServiceProvider.php`
```php
<?php
namespace App\Providers;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Support\Providers\EventServiceProvider as ServiceProvider;
// Import the Event and the Listeners
use App\Sales\Domain\Events\OrderWasPlaced;
use App\Notifications\Application\Listeners\SendOrderConfirmationEmailListener;
use App\Sales\Application\Projectors\OrderHistoryProjector;

class EventServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * The event to listener mappings for the application.
     *
     * @var array<class-string, array<int, class-string>>
     */
    protected $listen = [
        OrderWasPlaced::class => [
            // Listener of type "Reactor":
            SendOrderConfirmationEmailListener::class,
            
            // Listener of type "Projector":
            OrderHistoryProjector::class,
            
            // We can add future listeners here without touching other modules!
        ],
    ];

    /**
     * Register any events for your application.
     */
    public function boot(): void
    {
        //
    }
}
```
With this simple mapping, every time our `LaravelEventBus` dispatches `OrderWasPlaced`, Laravel's service container will automatically instantiate each of these listeners with their dependencies and call their `handle` method.

### Conclusion

We have closed the communication loop. The `Sales` module made a change and announced it. The `Notifications` and `Sales` (projector) modules listened and reacted independently. **Inter-module communication is now a reality, and it is completely decoupled.**

Tomorrow, we could add a `RegisterSaleInAnalyticsListener` by simply creating the class and adding it to the array in the `EventServiceProvider`. The rest of the system would remain untouched. This is the flexibility and power of an event-driven, modular architecture.

Furthermore, we've seen that we can make a listener asynchronous (executed in the background on a queue) by simply adding Laravel's `ShouldQueue` interface—a massive performance optimization that we get almost for free thanks to our architecture.

Now that our `Projector` is working in the background to keep our Redis cache updated, let's consume that data.

**In the next chapter, `Chapter 9: Implementing the Read Side: Queries and Read Models`, we will build the optimized path to read data and present it to the user in the most efficient way possible.**
