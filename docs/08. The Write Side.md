# Implementing the Write Side: Commands, Handlers, and Event Dispatching

In the previous chapter, we laid out the theory of CQRS. Now, let's roll up our sleeves and build the **Write Stack**. This is the path in our application responsible for any state change, protected by our business rules and optimized for consistency.

Our goal is to transform the `PlaceOrderService` we outlined into a formal `CommandHandler` and, most importantly, to ensure that the `Domain Events` recorded by our `Order` Aggregate are finally dispatched to the rest of the application.

### Step 1: The Command - The Formalized Intent

The first step is to formalize the user's intent. Our `PlaceOrderInput` DTO is already almost perfect for this, but we will rename it and place it in a specific directory to be explicit about its purpose: it's a **Command**.

`src/Sales/Application/Commands/PlaceOrder/PlaceOrderCommand.php`
```php
<?php
namespace App\Sales\Application\Commands\PlaceOrder;

/**
 * Represents the immutable intent to place an order.
 * It's a DTO that serves as a message for the Command Handler.
 */
final readonly class PlaceOrderCommand
{
    /**
     * @param string $customerId
     * @param array<int, array{productId: string, quantity: int}> $products
     */
    public function __construct(
        public string $customerId,
        public array $products
    ) {}
}
```

### Step 2: The Event Bus - The Decoupled Messenger

Before our handler can dispatch events, it needs an abstraction to do so. We don't want our `CommandHandler` to know about Laravel's specific event dispatcher. Therefore, we'll define an interface in our shared domain.

**A) The Interface**

`src/Shared/Domain/Bus/Event/EventBusInterface.php`
```php
<?php
namespace App\Shared\Domain\Bus\Event;

interface EventBusInterface
{
    public function dispatch(DomainEvent ...$events): void;
}
```

**B) The Laravel Implementation**

In the infrastructure layer, we create an implementation that wraps Laravel's native event dispatcher.

`src/Shared/Infrastructure/Bus/Event/LaravelEventBus.php`
```php
<?php
namespace App\Shared\Infrastructure\Bus\Event;

use App\Shared\Domain\Bus\Event\DomainEvent;
use App\Shared\Domain\Bus\Event\EventBusInterface;
use Illuminate\Bus\Dispatcher;

final class LaravelEventBus implements EventBusInterface
{
    public function __construct(private readonly Dispatcher $dispatcher)
    {
    }

    public function dispatch(DomainEvent ...$events): void
    {
        foreach ($events as $event) {
            $this->dispatcher->dispatch($event);
        }
    }
}
```

**C) The Wiring**

Finally, we tell Laravel's service container how to resolve this interface in a new `ServiceProvider` for our Buses.

`src/Shared/Infrastructure/Providers/BusServiceProvider.php`
```php
<?php
namespace App\Shared\Infrastructure\Providers;

use App\Shared\Domain\Bus\Event\EventBusInterface;
use App\Shared\Infrastructure\Bus\Event\LaravelEventBus;
use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;

final class BusServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function register(): void
    {
        $this->app->bind(EventBusInterface::class, LaravelEventBus::class);
    }
}
```
And we register `BusServiceProvider` in `bootstrap/app.php`.

### Step 3: The Command Handler - The Final Orchestrator

Now we're ready to build the `CommandHandler`. This class replaces our old `PlaceOrderService`. Its logic is very clear: it orchestrates the operation and, at the end, dispatches the events.

`src/Sales/Application/Commands/PlaceOrder/PlaceOrderCommandHandler.php`
```php
<?php
namespace App\Sales\Application\Commands\PlaceOrder;

use App\Sales\Domain\Entities\Order;
use App\Sales\Domain\Entities\OrderLine;
use App\Sales\Domain\Repositories\OrderRepositoryInterface;
use App\Sales\Domain\Services\ProductPriceFinder; // We assume this service exists
use App\Shared\Domain\Bus\Event\EventBusInterface;
use App\Shared\Domain\ValueObjects\CustomerId;
use App\Shared\Domain\ValueObjects\ProductId;

final class PlaceOrderCommandHandler
{
    public function __construct(
        private readonly OrderRepositoryInterface $orderRepository,
        private readonly ProductPriceFinder $priceFinder,
        private readonly EventBusInterface $eventBus // We inject our abstraction!
    ) {}

    public function handle(PlaceOrderCommand $command): void
    {
        // 1. Prepare data and create the Aggregate using its factory method.
        $orderId = $this->orderRepository->nextIdentity();
        $customerId = new CustomerId($command->customerId);
        
        $lines = [];
        foreach ($command->products as $productData) {
            $productId = new ProductId($productData['productId']);
            
            // We delegate finding the price to a domain service.
            $price = $this->priceFinder->findPriceFor($productId);

            $lines[] = new OrderLine(/* ... Parameters for the line ... */);
        }

        $order = Order::place($orderId, $customerId, $lines);

        // 2. Persist the Aggregate.
        $this->orderRepository->save($order);

        // 3. THE MAGIC! Pull the recorded events and dispatch them.
        // The '...' spread operator passes each element of the array as a separate argument.
        $this->eventBus->dispatch(...$order->pullDomainEvents());
    }
}
```

### Step 4: The Controller and the Command Bus

How does the controller invoke this handler? The cleanest way is through a **Command Bus**, which is very similar to our Event Bus. Instead of injecting the specific `PlaceOrderCommandHandler` into the controller, we inject a generic `CommandBusInterface`.

The controller simply creates the `Command` and dispatches it to the bus.

`src/Sales/Infrastructure/Http/Controllers/PlaceOrderController.php` (Example with a CommandBus)
```php
<?php
// ...
use App\Shared\Domain\Bus\Command\CommandBusInterface;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Http\JsonResponse;
use Illuminate\Http\Response;

final class PlaceOrderController extends Controller
{
    public function __construct(private readonly CommandBusInterface $commandBus)
    {
    }

    public function __invoke(Request $request): JsonResponse
    {
        // ... (Validation)
        
        // We create the command with the validated data.
        $command = new PlaceOrderCommand(
            customerId: $request->input('customer_id'),
            products: $request->input('products')
        );

        // We dispatch the command to the bus. We don't know who will handle it.
        $this->commandBus->dispatch($command);

        // A command doesn't return data, so we return an HTTP 202 (Accepted) response.
        return response()->json(null, Response::HTTP_ACCEPTED);
    }
}
```
*The implementation of a `CommandBus` is similar to the `EventBus` and is left as an advanced exercise, but the main idea is to decouple the client from the handler. To start, you could also inject the `PlaceOrderCommandHandler` directly into the controller and call its `handle` method.*

### Conclusion

We've done it! We have built a robust, explicit, and decoupled Write Stack.
- **Commands** represent clear intentions.
- **Handlers** orchestrate logic transactionally.
- Most importantly, at the end of a successful operation, our system now **dispatches Domain Events**.

Our `Sales` module has fired a flare into the air, announcing that an order has been placed. There's no one there to see that flare yet, but the signal has been sent.

**In the next chapter, `Chapter 8: Decoupled Communication: Domain Events and Listeners`, we will build the receivers. We will create the `Listeners` in other modules that will react to our events, finally enabling truly decoupled inter-module communication.**
