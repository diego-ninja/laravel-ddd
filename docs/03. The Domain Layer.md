# The Heart of the Business: The Domain Layer

In the previous chapters, we worked as architects: we designed our application's blueprint. Now, we put on our builder's helmet and start writing the most important and valuable code in the entire project: the code that lives in the **Domain Layer**.

This layer is the heart of our application. It contains the business rules, logic, and language, modeled as pure PHP objects. The fundamental rule of this layer, which we will repeat time and again, is: **zero external dependencies**. The code in here doesn't know what Laravel is, doesn't know what Eloquent is, and doesn't know how a database works. It's an isolated universe that only understands the rules of the business.

Let's start building its fundamental pieces.

### Value Objects: The Building Blocks

*(This section remains the same as its concept is foundational and unchanged).*

A **Value Object (or VO)** is a small, immutable object that represents a descriptive aspect of our domain. They are defined by their value, are immutable, and self-validate. Our `Email` Value Object is a perfect example of how they bring clarity and security to our code.

### Entities and Aggregates: The Guardians of Logic

If VOs are the descriptors, **Entities** are the main actors, defined by a unique identity. A cluster of Entities and VOs that are treated as a single unit of consistency forms an **Aggregate**, with an **Aggregate Root** as its single entry point.

But their responsibility goes beyond protecting their own state. When a business rule is met and the Aggregate's state changes, it must **announce that something important has happened**. It does this through **Domain Events**.

### Announcing Change: Recording Domain Events

A Domain Event is an immutable object that represents a business fact that occurred in the past. Its name should always reflect that past tense: `OrderWasPlaced`, `OrderWasShipped`.

**1. The Structure of an Event**

It's good practice to have a base class for events. We'll create it in a new `Shared` namespace, as it's a concept that can be shared across all our modules.

`src/Shared/Domain/Bus/Event/DomainEvent.php`
```php
<?php
namespace App\Shared\Domain\Bus\Event;

use Ramsey\Uuid\Uuid;
use DateTimeImmutable;

abstract class DomainEvent
{
    public readonly string $aggregateId;
    public readonly string $eventId;
    public readonly DateTimeImmutable $occurredOn;

    public function __construct(string $aggregateId, string $eventId = null, DateTimeImmutable $occurredOn = null)
    {
        $this->aggregateId = $aggregateId;
        $this->eventId = $eventId ?? Uuid::uuid4()->toString();
        $this->occurredOn = $occurredOn ?? new DateTimeImmutable();
    }
}
```

Now, let's create a specific event for our `Sales` module.

`src/Sales/Domain/Events/OrderWasPlaced.php`
```php
<?php
namespace App\Sales\Domain\Events;

use App\Shared\Domain\Bus\Event\DomainEvent;

final class OrderWasPlaced extends DomainEvent
{
    public function __construct(
        string $aggregateId, // The order ID
        public readonly string $customerId,
        public readonly array $lines,
        string $eventId = null,
        \DateTimeImmutable $occurredOn = null
    ) {
        parent::__construct($aggregateId, $eventId, $occurredOn);
    }

    // We could add methods here to convert the event to an array, etc.
}
```

**2. Recording Events in the Aggregate**

The Entity does not "dispatch" the event directly. It only **records** it in an internal log. To avoid repeating this logic in every Aggregate, we can use a base class.

`src/Shared/Domain/Aggregate/AggregateRoot.php` (This will be our base class for Aggregates)
```php
<?php
namespace App\Shared\Domain\Aggregate;

use App\Shared\Domain\Bus\Event\DomainEvent;

abstract class AggregateRoot
{
    private array $domainEvents = [];

    final public function pullDomainEvents(): array
    {
        $domainEvents = $this->domainEvents;
        $this->domainEvents = [];

        return $domainEvents;
    }

    final protected function record(DomainEvent $domainEvent): void
    {
        $this->domainEvents[] = $domainEvent;
    }
}
```

Now, our `Order` entity can use this behavior. Notice how the methods that change state now also record an event.

`src/Sales/Domain/Entities/Order.php` (Complete and Revised Version)
```php
<?php
namespace App\Sales\Domain\Entities;

use App\Sales\Domain\Events\OrderWasCanceled;
use App\Sales\Domain\Events\OrderWasPlaced;
use App\Sales\Domain\Events\OrderWasShipped;
use App\Sales\Domain\ValueObjects\OrderId;
use App\Sales\Domain\ValueObjects\OrderStatus;
use App\Shared\Domain\Aggregate\AggregateRoot;
use App\Shared\Domain\ValueObjects\CustomerId;
use DomainException;

final class Order extends AggregateRoot
{
    private OrderId $id;
    private array $lines = [];
    private OrderStatus $status;
    private CustomerId $customerId;

    // We'll use a static factory method for creation, which is a very common and clean pattern.
    public static function place(OrderId $id, CustomerId $customerId, array $lines): self
    {
        $order = new self();
        $order->id = $id;
        $order->customerId = $customerId;
        $order->status = OrderStatus::pending();
        $order->lines = $lines;

        // WE RECORD THE EVENT
        // The event contains all relevant information that other modules might need.
        $order->record(new OrderWasPlaced(
            aggregateId: $id->value(),
            customerId: $customerId->value(),
            lines: array_map(fn(OrderLine $line) => $line->toPrimitives(), $lines)
        ));

        return $order;
    }

    public function ship(): void
    {
        if (!$this->status->equals(OrderStatus::pending())) {
            throw new DomainException('Only pending orders can be shipped.');
        }

        $this->status = OrderStatus::shipped();
        $this->record(new OrderWasShipped($this->id->value())); // WE RECORD THE EVENT
    }

    public function cancel(): void
    {
        if ($this->status->equals(OrderStatus::shipped())) {
            throw new DomainException('Cannot cancel an order that has already been shipped.');
        }

        $this->status = OrderStatus::canceled();
        $this->record(new OrderWasCanceled($this->id->value())); // WE RECORD THE EVENT
    }
    
    // Getters
    public function id(): OrderId { return $this->id; }
    public function status(): OrderStatus { return $this->status; }
    // ... other getters
}
```
**Why "record" and not "dispatch"?** This is key to consistency. The Aggregate only notes in its logbook that something has happened. The events will only be released to the outside world (by the `CommandHandler` and the `EventBus`) **after** the entire operation, including saving to the database, has been successfully confirmed.

### Conclusion

We have greatly enriched our Domain Layer. Our Aggregates now not only protect business rules but also act as a source of historical truth, generating a trail of significant events.

This record of changes is the foundation upon which we will build decoupled communication between modules. We have created a Domain that not only *does* things but also *tells* what it has done.

Now that our Domain is more powerful, the next step remains the same: we need to persist its state.

**In the next chapter, `Chapter 4: Taming Eloquent: The Persistence Layer and Repositories`, we will build the bridge to save and retrieve our Aggregates, without the persistence layer worrying about the events they might contain.**
