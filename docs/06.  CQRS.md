# Chapter 6: Introducing CQRS: Separating Commands and Queries

In the previous chapter, we reached a fundamental revelation: the operations that **change** our application's state (writes) are fundamentally different from those that simply **read** it. Using our rich and complex Domain Model for simple read tasks is inefficient.

This revelation leads us directly to an advanced and powerful architectural pattern: **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**. This chapter is dedicated to exploring this pattern in depth, as it will become the cornerstone of our Application Layer.

### Breaking Down CQRS

CQRS is a principle that suggests a method in an object should be either:
* A **Command**, which performs an action and changes state, but does not return data.
* Or a **Query**, which returns data, but does not change state.
* ...but never both.

CQRS elevates this principle to the architectural level. Instead of having a single "model" for reading and writing data, we create two completely separate models, each optimized for its task: the **write stack** and the **read stack**.

Imagine a library. The process for cataloging a new book (a **write**) is complex: you must verify the ISBN, assign a category, apply tags, register its location... it's a process that guarantees data consistency. However, the process for a user to search for a book (a **read**) must be lightning-fast, querying an optimized index. CQRS applies this same logic to our software.

### The Write Stack: The World of Commands

This is the path responsible for all state modifications. It is, in essence, a formalization of what we have already begun to build.

**Key Components:**

1.  **The Command:** An immutable DTO whose name represents an intent to change, always in the imperative mood. Examples: `PlaceOrderCommand`, `CancelOrderCommand`, `AddProductToStockCommand`. Its sole responsibility is to encapsulate all the data needed to execute that action. **A command does not return data.**
2.  **The Command Handler:** A class dedicated to processing one specific type of command. It receives the `Command`, uses the `Repository` to load the Domain Aggregate, invokes business logic on the Aggregate, and finally, persists the changes. Our `PlaceOrderService` from the previous chapter is, in practice, a Command Handler.
3.  **The Command Bus:** (Optional, but highly recommended). This is a middleman that decouples the sender of the command from its handler. The client (e.g., a controller) dispatches a command to the bus, and the bus is responsible for finding and executing the correct handler. This is incredibly useful for adding cross-cutting concerns (logging, database transactions, validation) as middleware on the bus itself.

**The Write Flow:**
> Client → `dispatch(PlaceOrderCommand)` → Command Bus → `PlaceOrderCommandHandler` → Domain Model → Repository → Database

### The Read Stack: The World of Queries

This is the new path we will build, optimized for speed and efficiency.

**The Golden Rule:** The read stack **must never use the Domain Model (Aggregates) or the write Repositories**. Its goal is to be as direct as possible.

**Key Components:**

1.  **The Query:** A simple request for data. Unlike commands, this often doesn't need to be a formal object; it can simply be a method call with parameters.
2.  **The Query Handler:** A class that receives the data request. It interacts directly with the persistence layer (using Eloquent, Laravel's Query Builder, or even raw SQL) to build the most efficient query possible.
3.  **The Read Model:** This is the result returned by the `QueryHandler`. **It is not a Domain Entity.** It is a simple DTO or an array, shaped exactly for the needs of the view or client that requested it. It is "data plumbing," with no business logic.

**The Read Flow:**
> Client → `execute(GetOrderHistoryQuery)` → `GetOrderHistoryQueryHandler` → Eloquent/DB → DTO (Read Model) → Client

### Summary of Key Differences

| Feature         | Write Side (Commands)                        | Read Side (Queries)                          |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose** | Change the system's state.                   | Get the system's state.                      |
| **Returns Data?** | No (or at most, a void/ack).                 | Yes (a Read Model/DTO).                      |
| **Model Used** | Rich Domain Model (Aggregates).              | Direct data access (Eloquent, SQL).          |
| **Complexity** | High (business rules, invariants).           | Low (generally, a `SELECT` query).           |
| **Main Focus** | **Data Consistency.** | **Read Performance.** |


### Conclusion

CQRS might seem like it adds more classes and complexity, but in reality, it **simplifies** our system. Instead of a single model trying to do two opposite things poorly, we have two highly specialized models that each do one thing excellently.

We use our powerful, but "heavier," Domain Model for what is irreplaceable: ensuring data integrity when writing. And for reads, we create a super-efficient shortcut that delivers data at lightning speed.

Now that we have laid the theoretical foundation of CQRS, we are ready to get our hands dirty.

**In the next chapter, we will focus exclusively on the write stack and refactor it to formally follow this pattern: `Chapter 7: Implementing the Write Side: Commands, Handlers, and Event Dispatching`.**
